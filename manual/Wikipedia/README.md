# I- Object of the Contribution

The present directory aims at making public a qualitative analysis on 50 Wikipedia comparison pages. 
In this study, the authors evaluated each cell of the multiple Wikipedia Product Comparison Matrices (PCMs) against a set of 8 different variability information type:

1. yes/no answers
2. limited/constrained/partial answered
3. single value
4. multi-values
5. unknown answer
6. empty answer
7. inconsistent answer
8. additional extra information 

The aim of the study is to understand the different variability information contained in such PCM to evaluate the gap between PCM and more formal variability models such as Feature models (FMs).
The objective is to further interpret these PCMs and synthesize the related feature models, accordingly to the variability information found in the matrices.


# II- Organization of the directory

* The file 'Wikipedia PCMs synthesis informaion.txt' synthesizes the results of the extraction of the different elicitated comparison pages in Wikipedia.
From the gathered 381 pages, we automatically analyze each one of them to determine the number of headers and products under comparison, number of tables, etC.
We distribute each pages on 12 different families accordingly to their size (number of headers) (0 // 1-10 // 11-20 // ... // 91-100 // 100+)
We compute the frequency of each family.
For our analysis, we randomly choose a set of 50 comparison pages accordingly to the family distribution.

* The directory 'Wikipedia Case Study' contains the 50 comparison pages in their different family folders.
Each folder is divided into a 'source' and 'evaluation' folders, which respectively contain the initial extraction from wikipedia into different Excel spreadsheets, and the related evaluation of each cell.
Each PCM is evaluated individually. The evaluation is showed in the first page of each Excel spreadsheet.

* The Folder 'Synthesis Evaluation' contain a global analysis overs quantitative measures performed on the different PCMs.
