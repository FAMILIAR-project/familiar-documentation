This document presents: 
 
 * a comprehensive tutorial on feature model composition, showing the equivalence of various operators and mechanims offered by the FAMILIAR language
 * numerous examples (toy examples or based on the revisit of existing works)
 * the associated FAMILIAR scripts as well as the packaged version to play with the tool

Our ultimate goal is to provide solutions that fulfill the various needs of variability model composition.
