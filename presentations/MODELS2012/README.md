# Next-Generation Model-based Variability Management: Languages and Tools

The tutorial has been presented at MODELS'12 conference 

> Variability modelling and management is a key activity in a growing
> number of software engineering contexts, from software product lines to dynamic
> adaptive systems. Feature models are the defacto standard to formally represent
> and reason about commonality and variability of a software system. This tutorial
> aims at presenting next generation of feature modelling languages (FAMILIAR, TVL) and tools,
> directly applicable to a wide range of model-based variability problems and application
> domains. Participants (being practitioners or academics, beginners or advanced)
> will learn the principles and foundations of languages and tool-supported
> techniques dedicated to the model-based management of variability.

 * Mathieu Acher (INRIA/University of Rennes I), actual presenter at the conference
 * Patrick Heymans (University of Namur)
 * Philippe Collet (University of Nice Sophia Antipolis)

## Material

 * slides of the tutorial (TODO: link)
 * related articles (TODO: links)
 * FAMILIAR scripts / TVL models (TODO: links)
 
and packaged tools to interactively play with the models during the tutorial.
FAMILIAR instructions: (TODO link)


## TVL

Note that FAMILIAR supports TVL models in Boolean forms and therefore does include TVL...
If you're specifically interested by TVL, you can visit  http://info.fundp.ac.be/tvl/ (including grammar, resources describing formal semantics, standalone implementation, etc.)
