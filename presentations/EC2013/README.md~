# Next-Generation Model-based Variability Management: Languages and Tools

The tutorial has been presented at MODELS'12 conference 

> Variability modelling and management is a key activity in a growing
> number of software engineering contexts, from software product lines to dynamic
> adaptive systems. Feature models are the defacto standard to formally represent
> and reason about commonality and variability of a software system. This tutorial
> aims at presenting next generation of feature modelling languages (FAMILIAR, TVL) and tools,
> directly applicable to a wide range of model-based variability problems and application
> domains. Participants (being practitioners or academics, beginners or advanced)
> will learn the principles and foundations of languages and tool-supported
> techniques dedicated to the model-based management of variability.
