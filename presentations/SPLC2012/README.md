# Next-Generation Model-based Variability Management: Languages and Tools

The tutorial has been presented at SPLC'12 conference 

> This tutorial aims at presenting new feature modelling tools directly applicable to a wide range of variability problems and application domains. 
> Techniques and languages (FAMILIAR, TVL) for modelling, managing and configuring feature models will
> be illustrated and explained to participants (practitioners or academics, beginners or advanced).

## Authors

 * Mathieu Acher (INRIA/University of Rennes I), actual presenter at the conference (presentation made during this post-doc at University of Namur)
 * Patrick Heymans (University of Namur)
 * RaphaÃ«l Michel (University of Namur / CETIC)
 
## Material

 * slides of the tutorial (TODO: link)
 * 2-pages summary and presentation of the tutorial (in proceedings of SPLC'12 TODO)
 * related articles (TODO: links)
 * FAMILIAR scripts / TVL models (TODO: links)
 
and packaged tools to interactively play with the models during the tutorial.
FAMILIAR instructions: (TODO link)


### TVL

Note that FAMILIAR supports TVL models in Boolean forms and therefore does include TVL. 
If you're specifically interested by TVL, you can visit  http://info.fundp.ac.be/tvl/ (including grammar, resources describing formal semantics, standalone implementation, etc.)
