# Feature Model Management: Smart Operations and Language Support

The tutorial has been presented at MODELS'13 conference: http://models2013.lcc.uma.es/tutorials.html#TT7

> Variability modelling and management is pervasive in a growing number of software engineering contexts (e.g., software product lines, dynamic adaptive systems). Feature models are the de facto standard to formally represent and reason about commonality and variability of a software system. This tutorial aims at present- ing feature modelling languages and tools, directly applicable to a wide range of model-based variability problems and application domains. We will explain how to import, export, compose, de-compose, edit, configure, compute diffs, refactor, reverse engineer, test, or reason about (multiple) feature models. We will also il- lustrate how these "smart" operations can be combined to realize complex variability management tasks. Participants (being practi- tioners or academics, beginners or advanced) will learn the princi- ples and foundations of tool-supported techniques dedicated to the model-based management of variability.

## Material

 * slides of the tutorial: soon available...
 * FAMILIAR scripts: https://github.com/FAMILIAR-project/familiar-documentation/tree/master/scriptsRepository/MODELS2013
 
and packaged tools to interactively play with the models during the tutorial.
The FAMILIAR instructions are here:

Note that we provide basically three versions of FAMILIAR: 
two standalone versions (with or without graphical environment) and an Eclipse-based plugin (see below)
